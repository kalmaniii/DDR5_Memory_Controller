### Guide
>There will be test cases under each test folder. The names of these folders are the same in the outline, so you should be able to quickly find the test cases' descriptions and the expected results.

#### Add Results
>Please move the tested output file into the same folder for whichever trace file you tested. Name the results file: "test_case_#_result.txt", where '#' is replaced with the number. TBH if it's too long we could do "result#.txt", as long as it's consistant across the board. 

#### Update "last_tested.md"
>Also, update the last_tested.md under the test folder (the same folder this readme is located).
